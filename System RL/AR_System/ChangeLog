Updated to version 14 by PET Eng Comp (www.inf.ufes.br/~pet):
- Changed general parameters - ServerSettings.cpp
- Added new general parameters and their functions set and get - ServerSettings.cpp / ServerSettings.h
- Added new play modes "FOUL_CHARGE", "YELLOW_CARD" and "RED_CARD" and updated reading of referee messagen in order to read these states.
Foul charge happens when a player performs a dangerous tackle. When it happens, the player can receive a yellow / red card.
- Updated function isDeadBallUs() and isDeadBallThem, adding foul_charge, yellow_card and red_card
- Created vectors int yellowCardsUs[11] and yellowCardsThem[11] in WorldModel.h 
indicating the amount of yellow cards of each player. Initialized in creation of WorldModel.cpp
- Created function getNumberYellowCards(objectT o) that returns the number of yellow cards of the player o;
- Created function WorldModel::updateYellowCards() that update the number of yellow cards based on the play mode
This function is used in function SenseHandler::analyzeHearMessage
- Updated the reading of "sense_body" messages in order to read foul charged and yellow/red cards.
- Updated command tackle. Now, the first parameter ever indicates the angle of the tackle.
Added second parameter, that indicates intentional foul.
- Changed default version of the coach - mainCoach.cpp
- Changed default version of the player - main.cpp
- Added parameters CatchableAreaLMin, CatchableAreaLMax and FoulDetectProbability in class HeteroPlayerSettings  
- Updated functions SenseHandler::analyzePlayerTypeMessage, WorldModelprocessNewHeteroPlayer to read and store new hetero player parameters

--- We did NOT changed / added:
- The flags [y|r] in the end of see message are not verified. They are already processed through of referee messages
- Not updated see in full state to read the flags [f,y,r]. The flag f, indicates that a player is lying on the ground. Y and R indicates yellow and red cards.

- Changed default version of the coach - mainCoach.cpp
- Changed default version of the player - main.cpp
- Changed general parameters - ServerSettings.cpp
- Added new general parameters and their functions set and get - ServerSettings.cpp / ServerSettings.h
- Substituted function call getMaxPower() by getMaxDashPower() and getMinPower() by getMinDashPower(), when it was refering to dash - WorldModelHighLevel.cpp / WordModel.cpp / BasicPlayer.cpp / SoccerTypes.cpp / WordlModelPredict.cpp
- Updated the reading of "sense_body" messages in order to read stamina capacity
- Updated the reading of "see" messages in order to read command kick
- Updated functions related with dash in order to use the new parameter angle - SoccerTypes.h / SoccerTypes.cpp
- Added function getCycleLastTackle(Object o) that returns the cycle of the last tackle of the player - Objects.h / Objects.cpp / WorldModel.cpp / WorldModel.h / WorldModelUpdate.cpp
- Added function setCycleAgentLastTackle() and used in function tackle.- Objects.h / Objects.cpp / WorldModel.cpp / WorldModel.h / WorldModelUpdate.cpp
- Added function TurnSideToPoint() and moveToPos2 in order to make the new dash command, with the direction parameter. The other functions that make dash commands were changed to pass the direction zero as the direction parameter, that makes a forward dash.
- Changed Stamina class in order to added the information about the "capacity"
- Changed functions dashToPoint(), makeDashCommand() and SoccerCommand::SoccerCommand() in order to make the new dash command
